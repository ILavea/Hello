# The Wonderful World of Licensing

This is a free page of random tips and tricks from my time working in licensing (and to teach me how to make a wesbite!). 
Please always do your own research too, and be sure to check with your local licensing authority for the most up to date information. They know best!

## TENs, Premise Licences and Club Premise Licences, Oh My!

It's largely all about scale and frequency. 

- Small scale and one off events, will be a TEN (Temporary Event Notice). e.g. A school summer fair.
- Large scale or more frequent business, will be a premise licence. e.g. A pub.
- Community organisations or clubs, open only to their own members and not the general public, will be a Club Premise. e.g. A rotary club.

Then there will be overlap where it is down to your judgement which is best for you in terms of time and effort, and whether you are likely to have objections from your community.

e.g. Your PTA does 5 events per year. Depending on your council's fees, the cost of 5 TENs may well equal the cost of a premise licence. A premise licence is more complicated to get, but once you have it no more applications! Just bear in mind it does come with an annual fee...

### TENs

The number one reason for a TEN to be rejected is it's submitted too late. Your council ideally need 10 clear working days, not including the day of the event, or the day you apply, to process your application. This is so they have time to consult with people, such as the police, the fire depertment or the environmental protection team, to ensure your event is safe, secure, and friendly to your neighbours.
